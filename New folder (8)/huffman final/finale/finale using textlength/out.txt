Preface 
Database management has evolved from a specialized computer application to a 
central component of a modern computing environment, and, as a result, knowledge 
about database systems has become an essential part of an education in 
computer science. In this text, we present the fundamental concepts of database 
management. These concepts include aspects of database design, database languages, 
and database-system implementation. 
This text is intended for a first course in databases at the junior or senior 
undergraduate, or first-year graduate, level. In addition to basic material for 
a first course, the text contains advanced material that can be used for course 
supplements, or as introductory material for an advanced course. 
We assume only a familiarity with basic data structures, computer organization, 
and a high-level programming language such as Java, C, or Pascal. We 
present concepts as intuitive descriptions, many of which are based on our running 
example of a university. Important theoretical results are covered, but formal 
proofs are omitted. In place of proofs, figures and examples are used to suggest 
why a result is true. Formal descriptions and proofs of theoretical results may 
be found in research papers and advanced texts that are referenced in the bibliographical 
notes. 
The fundamental concepts and algorithms covered in the book are often 
based on those used in existing commercial or experimental database systems. 
Our aim is to present these concepts and algorithms in a general setting that is 
not tied to one particular database system. Details of particular database systems 
are discussed in Part 9, “Case Studies.” 
In this, the sixth edition of Database System Concepts, we have retained the 
overall style of the prior editions while evolving the content and organization to 
reflect the changes that are occurring in theway databases are designed, managed, 
and used. We have also taken into account trends in the teaching of database 
concepts and made adaptations to facilitate these trends where appropriate.

xvi Preface 
Organization 
The text is organized in nine major parts, plus five appendices. 
• Overview (Chapter 1). Chapter 1 provides a general overview of the nature 
and purpose of database systems.We explain how the concept of a database 
system has developed, what the common features of database systems are, 
what a database system does for the user, and how a database system interfaces 
with operating systems. We also introduce an example database 
application: a university organization consisting of multiple departments, 
instructors, students, and courses. This application is used as a running example 
throughout the book. This chapter is motivational, historical, and explanatory 
in nature. 
• Part 1: Relational Databases (Chapters 2 through 6). Chapter 2 introduces 
the relational model of data, covering basic concepts such as the structure 
of relational databases, database schemas, keys, schema diagrams, relational 
query languages, and relational operations. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 focus on the 
most influential of the user-oriented relational languages: SQL. Chapter 6 covers 
the formal relational query languages: relational algebra, tuple relational 
calculus, and domain relational calculus. 
The chapters in this part describe data manipulation: queries, updates, insertions, 
and deletions, assuming a schemadesign has been provided. Schema 
design issues are deferred to Part 2. 
• Part 2: Database Design (Chapters 7 through 9). Chapter 7 provides an 
overview of the database-design process, with major emphasis on database 
design using the entity-relationship data model. The entity-relationship data 
model provides a high-level view of the issues in database design, and of the 
problems that we encounter in capturing the semantics of realistic applications 
within the constraints of a data model. UML class-diagram notation is 
also covered in this chapter. 
Chapter 8 introduces the theory of relational database design. The theory 
of functional dependencies and normalization is covered, with emphasis 
on the motivation and intuitive understanding of each normal form. This 
chapter begins with an overview of relational design and relies on an intuitive 
understanding of logical implication of functional dependencies. This 
allows the concept of normalization to be introduced prior to full coverage 
of functional-dependency theory, which is presented later in the chapter. Instructors 
may choose to use only this initial coverage in Sections 8.1 through 
8.3without loss of continuity. Instructors covering the entire chapterwill benefit 
fromstudents having a good understanding of normalization concepts to 
motivate some of the challenging concepts of functional-dependency theory. 
Chapter 9 covers application design and development. This chapter emphasizes 
the construction of database applications withWeb-based interfaces. In 
addition, the chapter covers application security.
